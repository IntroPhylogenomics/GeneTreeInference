# Inferring Gene Trees

This repository contains tutorials for learning about maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference of trees from individual genes. For ML inference, we will use [IQTree](http://www.iqtree.org). For Bayesian inference, we will use [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io).

- Maximum likelihood model selection
- Maximum likelihood inference
- Nonparametric bootstrapping

- Bayesian model selection
- Bayesian inference with Markov chain Monte Carlo
