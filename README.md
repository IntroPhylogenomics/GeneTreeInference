# Inferring Gene Trees

This repository contains tutorials for learning about maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference of trees from individual genes. For ML inference, we will use [IQTree](http://www.iqtree.org). For Bayesian inference, we will use [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io). We will also use RevBayes to learn about some fundamentals of probability.
