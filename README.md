# Inferring Gene Trees

This repository contains tutorials for learning about maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference of trees from individual genes. For ML inference, we will use [IQTree](http://www.iqtree.org). For Bayesian inference, we will use [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io). We will also use RevBayes to learn about some fundamentals of probability. [AliView](http://www.ormbunkar.se/aliview/) will also be helpful to view sequence alignments, and [FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) will be helpful to view trees.
