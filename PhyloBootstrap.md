# Phylogenetic Bootstrapping with IQTree

[IQTree Documentation on Bootstrapping](http://www.iqtree.org/doc/Tutorial#assessing-branch-supports-with--standard-nonparametric-bootstrap)

To run a bootstrapping analysis in IQTree, we can use nearly the same command that we used to run a standard maximum likelihood tree search. We just add `-b <NUM_BOOTSTRAP_REPLICATES>` to the end of the command.

Return to the turtles data and run a nonparametric bootstrapping analysis on at least one dataset (concatenated or one of the individual genes) using a particular model.

If you have time, run multiple models and compare the results.
